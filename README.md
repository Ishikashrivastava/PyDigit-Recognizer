# PyDigit-Recognizer
This description succinctly conveys that the project involves recognizing  digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in PyTorch.
Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset is a major project built with the help of a Neural Network. It primarily detects scanned images of handwritten digits. 

We have taken this a step further. Our system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits but also allows users to write digits directly on the screen using an integrated GUI, facilitating real-time recognition.
